# hello-world
My very first repository

Hello, my name is Michael and I am a self taught computer programmer that has been coding for about 1 week. I have a full time job and will be attending university via the internet in starting in December 2017. I'm going to be using this site to learn, develop my skills as a programmer and hopefully find a niche in the worls of software engineering.
